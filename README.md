# sugarscape
Various filed implementing an event-driven simulation model of agents living on a cell-based grid, who can move, eat, die, find partners, and reproduce.
The working version is SugarscapeSimulusv2.py.
To use, mess with the parameters in the beginning of the file and run 'python3 SugarscapeSimulusv2.py' to run simulation with the provided parameters.

In the future, the plan is to include functions/methods to record time-averaged statistics.
